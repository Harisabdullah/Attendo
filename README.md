# Attendo
Attendo is an Android app that allows teachers to mark the attendance of their students using QR codes. With Attendo, teachers can generate a QR code for their classes that students can scan to mark their attendance. This saves time and effort for teachers and provides a convenient way for students to register their attendance.
